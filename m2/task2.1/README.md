# Task 2.1
## Part 1

The most popular hypervisors for infrastructure virtualization are:

1. VMware vSphere Hypervisor
2. Microsoft Hyper-v
3. Citrix XenServer
4. Oracle VirtualBox
5. Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor

For example the main differences of VMware vSphere and Oracle VM VirtualBox is a hypervisor type. VMware vSphere (and Microsoft Hyper-V also) is type 1 hypervisor and it runs as a control program directly on the hardware side of the computer. Virtual machine operating systems run higher.

Oracle VM VirtualBox is a type 2 hypervisor and it runs on the host operating system and guest virtual machine operating systems are at a higher level.

## Part 2 VirtualBox

Instaled the latest stable version of VirtualBox and downloaded the latest stable version of Ubuntu Desktop 20.04.3. Created VM1 and install Ubuntu

Connected to the VM using the program MobaXterm and executed the **date** command
<img src="./images/vagrant-login.jpeg">

After that created my own Vagrant box

```
# -*- mode: ruby -*-
# vi: set ft=ruby :

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "ubuntu/trusty64"
  config.vm.box_check_update = false
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    vb.name = "ubuntu-test-first"
    vb.memory = 2048
    vb.cpus = 1
  end

  config.vm.synced_folder "../share-vagrant", "/vagrant_data"
  config.vm.network "private_network", type: "dhcp"

end
```

Created a test environment from a few servers
