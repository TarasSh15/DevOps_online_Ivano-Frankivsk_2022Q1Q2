## Part 1

The most popular hypervisors for infrastructure virtualization are:

1. VMware vSphere Hypervisor
2. Microsoft Hyper-v
3. Citrix XenServer
4. Oracle VirtualBox
5. Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Hypervisor

For example the main differences of VMware vSphere and Oracle VM VirtualBox is a hypervisor type. VMware vSphere (and Microsoft Hyper-V also) is type 1 hypervisor and it runs as a control program directly on the hardware side of the computer. Virtual machine operating systems run higher.

Oracle VM VirtualBox is a type 2 hypervisor and it runs on the host operating system and guest virtual machine operating systems are at a higher level.

## Part 2 VirtualBox
